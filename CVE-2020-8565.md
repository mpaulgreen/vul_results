## Vulnerability Analysis

### Summary <a name='summary' id='summary'></a>(<span style='color:#4CAF50'>Not Exploitable</span>)
Based on the provided Checklist and Findings, the CVE is not exploitable. The investigation results show that the logging level in the Kubernetes environment is not set to a level that would allow authorization and bearer tokens to be written to log files (Checklist Item 1), and there is no evidence of these tokens being written to the logs of the API server and client tools like kubectl (Checklist Item 2).

### Justification <a name='justification' id='justification'></a> 


>label: requires_configuration

The CVE is not exploitable because the logging level in the Kubernetes environment is not set to a level that would allow authorization and bearer tokens to be written to log files, which is a necessary condition for exploitability.

## Checklist Details <a name='checklist' id='checklist'></a>

## Step 1 <a name='checklist-step-1' id='checklist-step-1'></a> : Verify Logging Level


> **Input**: *Verify Logging Level: Check the logging level configuration within the Kubernetes environment to determine if it is set to at least 9, which would allow authorization and bearer tokens to be written to log files.*

> **Response**: *No, the logging level in the Kubernetes environment is not set to at least 9. It is set to 0, as indicated by the argument "--v=0".*

### Step 1.1 : *Container Image Developer Guide QA System*<a name='checklist-step-1.1' id='checklist-step-1.1'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: To verify the logging level configuration within the Kubernetes environment, I need to check the configuration settings. However, I don't have direct access to the Kubernetes environment. I can try to find information about the logging level configuration in the container image developer guide.

Action: Container Image Developer Guide QA System
Action Input: What is the logging level configuration in the Kubernetes environment?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>What is the logging level configuration in the Kubernetes environment?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>The logging level configuration in the Kubernetes environment is as follows:

* Level 10 is for debug and trace style logs
* Level 1 is for chattier info-type logs
* Level -4 is pre-defined for debug logs, which corresponds to level 4 in logr.

Note that these levels are mentioned in the context as being recommended for Kubernetes.</pre>

Use a `GroupKind` object to log them instead, or a `GroupVersionKind` when version is relevant. - If you need to log an API version string, use `api version` as the key (formatted as with a `GroupVersion`, or as received directly from API discovery).</details> |

If you&#x27;ve only used a logging library like the &quot;log&quot; package (in the Go standard library) or &quot;glog&quot; (in Kubernetes), you&#x27;ll need to adjust how you think about logging a bit. ### Getting Started With Structured Logging With structured logging, we associate a \*constant\* log message with some variable key-value pairs. For instance, suppose we wanted to log that we were starting reconciliation on a pod. In the Go standard library logger, we might write: ```go log.Printf(&quot;starting reconciliation for pod %s/%s&quot;, podNamespace, podName) ``` In controller-runtime, we&#x27;d instead write:</details> |

> **Input**: *Inspect API Server and Client Tool Logs: Review the logs of the API server and client tools like kubectl to check for any instances of authorization and bearer tokens being written to the logs.*

> **Response**: *No, the container image does not write authorization and bearer tokens to the logs of the API server and client tools like kubectl.*

### Step 2.1 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-2.1' id='checklist-step-2.1'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: To answer this question, I need to determine if the container image under investigation writes authorization and bearer tokens to the logs of the API server and client tools like kubectl. I should first check if the container image uses any logging mechanisms that might write sensitive information to the logs.

Action: Container Image Code QA System
Action Input: Does the container image use any logging libraries or mechanisms that write logs to the API server or client tools like kubectl?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>Does the container image use any logging libraries or mechanisms that write logs to the API server or client tools like kubectl?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>No, the container image does not appear to use any logging libraries or mechanisms that write logs to the API server or client tools like kubectl. The logging configuration is set up using the Zap logging library, which is a general-purpose logging library for Go, and the logs are not explicitly configured to be written to the API server or client tools.</pre>

I should next check the container image's documentation to see if there are any specific guidelines or configurations related to accessing log files in the context of API server logs and client tool output like kubectl.

| None | Document | vendor/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/TMP-LOGGING.md | <details><summary>View Content</summary>- If you need to log an API version string, use `api version` as the key (formatted as with a `GroupVersion`, or as received directly from API discovery). ### Objects and Types - If code works with a generic Kubernetes `runtime.Object`, use the `object` key. For specific objects, prefer the resource name as the key (e.g. `pod` for `v1.Pod` objects). - For non-Kubernetes objects, the `object` key may also be used, if you accept a generic interface. - When logging a raw type, log it using the `type` key, with a value of `fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%T&quot;, typ)`</details> |
| None | Document | vendor/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/TMP-LOGGING.md | <details><summary>View Content</summary>## Logging Structured Values (Key-Value pairs) - Use lower-case, space separated keys. For example `object` for objects, `api version` for `APIVersion` - Be consistent across your application, and with controller-runtime when possible. - Try to be brief but descriptive. - Match terminology in keys with terminology in the message. - Be careful logging non-Kubernetes objects verbatim if they&#x27;re very large. ### Groups, Versions, and Kinds - Kinds should not be logged alone (they&#x27;re meaningless alone). Use a `GroupKind` object to log them instead, or a `GroupVersionKind` when version is relevant. - If you need to log an API version string, use `api version` as the key (formatted as with a `GroupVersion`, or as received directly from API discovery).</details> |
| None | Document | vendor/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/TMP-LOGGING.md | <details><summary>View Content</summary>Logging Guidelines ================== controller-runtime uses a kind of logging called \*structured logging\*. If you&#x27;ve used a library like Zap or logrus before, you&#x27;ll be familiar with the concepts we use. If you&#x27;ve only used a logging library like the &quot;log&quot; package (in the Go standard library) or &quot;glog&quot; (in Kubernetes), you&#x27;ll need to adjust how you think about logging a bit. ### Getting Started With Structured Logging With structured logging, we associate a \*constant\* log message with some variable key-value pairs. For instance, suppose we wanted to log that we were starting reconciliation on a pod. In the Go standard library logger, we might write: ```go log.Printf(&quot;starting reconciliation for pod %s/%s&quot;, podNamespace, podName) ``` In controller-runtime, we&#x27;d instead write:</details> |

For reference, slog pre-defines -4 for debug logs (corresponds to 4 in logr), which matches what is [recommended for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-instrumentation/logging.md#what-method-to-use). #### How do I choose my keys? Keys are fairly flexible, and can hold more or less any string value. For best compatibility with implementations and consistency with existing code in other projects, there are a few conventions you should consider.</details> |
