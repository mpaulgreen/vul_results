## CVE-2024-41110 
> GHSA-ID: GHSA-v23v-6jw2-98fq <a name='cve-intro' id='cve-intro'></a>


 A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass [authorization plugins (AuthZ)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low. This advisory outlines the issue, identifies the affected versions, and provides remediation steps for impacted users.

### Impact

Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an [authorization plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/) without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.


A security issue was discovered In 2018,  where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine [v18.09.1](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/#security-fixes-1) in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime **are not vulnerable.**

### Vulnerability details

- **AuthZ bypass and privilege escalation:** An attacker could exploit a bypass using an API request with Content-Length set to 0, causing the Docker daemon to forward the request without the body to the AuthZ plugin, which might approve the request incorrectly.
- **Initial fix:** The issue was fixed in Docker Engine [v18.09.1](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/#security-fixes-1) January 2019..
- **Regression:** The fix was not included in Docker Engine v19.03 or newer versions. This was identified in April 2024 and patches were released for the affected versions on July 23, 2024. The issue was assigned [CVE-2024-41110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-41110).

### Patches

- docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability.
- Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.0, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

### Remediation steps

- If you are running an affected version, update to the most recent patched version.
- Mitigation if unable to update immediately:
    - Avoid using AuthZ plugins.
    - Restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.

## Checklist Details <a name='checklist' id='checklist'></a>

## Step 1 <a name='checklist-step-1' id='checklist-step-1'></a> : Verify Docker Engine API Client Usage


> **Input**: *Verify Docker Engine API Client Usage: Check if the Docker Engine API client is used within the containerized environment to make requests that could potentially bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ).*

> **Response**: *The Docker Engine API client is used within the containerized environment, specifically by the `app.DockerClientSearcher`, but it's unclear if it bypasses authorization plugins (AuthZ).*

### Step 1.1 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-1.1' id='checklist-step-1.1'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: To verify if the Docker Engine API client is used within the containerized environment, I need to check the code of the container image and its dependencies. I should use the Container Image Code QA System to search for any usage of the Docker Engine API client.

Action: Container Image Code QA System
Action Input: Does the container image or any of its dependencies use the Docker Engine API client to make requests?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>Does the container image or any of its dependencies use the Docker Engine API client to make requests?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>No, the code does not use the Docker Engine API client to make requests. Instead, it uses a fake Docker client (`FakeDockerClient`) for testing purposes, which returns pre-defined images and errors. In the production code, it uses an `app.DockerClientSearcher` which is configured with an `ExactMatchDockerSearcher` as its registry searcher, but it does not directly use the Docker Engine API client.</pre>

### Step 1.2 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-1.2' id='checklist-step-1.2'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: Based on the observation from the Container Image Code QA System, it appears that the container image does not directly use the Docker Engine API client to make requests. Instead, it uses a fake Docker client for testing purposes and an `app.DockerClientSearcher` with an `ExactMatchDockerSearcher` as its registry searcher in production code. However, I need to verify if the `app.DockerClientSearcher` or `ExactMatchDockerSearcher` could potentially bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ).

Action: Container Image Code QA System
Action Input: Does the `app.DockerClientSearcher` or `ExactMatchDockerSearcher` use the Docker Engine API client to make requests that could potentially bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ)?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>Does the `app.DockerClientSearcher` or `ExactMatchDockerSearcher` use the Docker Engine API client to make requests that could potentially bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ)?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>Based on the provided context, it appears that `app.DockerClientSearcher` uses the Docker Engine API client to make requests, as evidenced by the `Client` field being set to a `FakeDockerClient` instance, which is likely a mock implementation of the Docker Engine API client.

However, I couldn't find any information in the provided context that suggests whether these requests could potentially bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ).

As for `ExactMatchDockerSearcher`, I couldn't find any information in the provided context that suggests it uses the Docker Engine API client at all. It's possible that it's a separate implementation that doesn't rely on the Docker Engine API client.

Therefore, I can only say that `app.DockerClientSearcher` uses the Docker Engine API client, but I don't know if it bypasses authorization plugins (AuthZ). I don't have enough information to say anything about `ExactMatchDockerSearcher`.</pre>

## Step 2 <a name='checklist-step-2' id='checklist-step-2'></a> : Inspect Authorization Plugin Configuration


> **Input**: *Inspect Authorization Plugin Configuration: Review the configuration of authorization plugins used within the containerized environment. Ensure that plugins are properly configured to handle requests and responses, including the forwarding of request or response bodies.*

> **Response**: *The authorization plugin configuration in the container image is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that authorization and access control is managed through a distributed trust graph in the libtrust library. The libtrust library is imported in the container image, but it is not used. The purpose of importing the libtrust library is not clear from the provided context.*

### Step 2.1 : *Container Image Developer Guide QA System*<a name='checklist-step-2.1' id='checklist-step-2.1'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: To inspect the authorization plugin configuration, I need to understand what authorization plugins are used within the containerized environment and how they are configured. I should first ask the Container Image Developer Guide QA System about the authorization plugins used in the container image.

Action: Container Image Developer Guide QA System
Action Input: What authorization plugins are used in the container image?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>What authorization plugins are used in the container image?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>I don't know. The text does not mention specific authorization plugins used in the container image. It does mention that authorization and access control is managed through a distributed trust graph in the libtrust library, but it does not provide information about plugins.</pre>

## Step 3 <a name='checklist-step-3' id='checklist-step-3'></a> : Assess Request and Response Handling


> **Input**: *Assess Request and Response Handling: Evaluate how the containerized application handles requests and responses, particularly in relation to authorization plugins. Check if the application properly forwards request or response bodies to plugins, and if plugins correctly handle these bodies to make access control decisions.*

> **Response**: *The containerized application does not appear to use any authorization plugins, and the provided context does not contain information about how it handles requests and responses in relation to Docker authentication. However, it does handle Docker authentication and credential management. The application handles requests and responses using an HTTP server, and can serve TLS requests if a TLS key and certificate are provided.*

### Step 3.1 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-3.1' id='checklist-step-3.1'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: To assess the request and response handling of the containerized application, I need to understand how the application interacts with authorization plugins. I should first check if the application uses any authorization plugins and how it integrates with them.

Action: Container Image Code QA System
Action Input: Does the containerized application use any authorization plugins?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>Does the containerized application use any authorization plugins?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>No, the provided context does not mention anything about authorization plugins. It appears to be related to Docker authentication and credential management, but there is no mention of plugins.</pre>

### Step 3.3 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-3.3' id='checklist-step-3.3'></a>


#### Action Log 
<pre>Thought: The containerized application does not appear to use any authorization plugins, and the provided context does not contain information about how it handles requests and responses in relation to Docker authentication. However, it does handle Docker authentication and credential management. To further assess the request and response handling, I should investigate how the application handles requests and responses in general.

Action: Container Image Code QA System
Action Input: How does the containerized application handle requests and responses?
 </pre>


#### Tool Input 
<pre>How does the containerized application handle requests and responses?
 </pre>


#### Tool Output 
<pre>Based on the provided context, it appears that the containerized application handles requests and responses using an HTTP server. The code snippet shows an HTTP handler function that sets the content type of the response based on the request URL path, and serves files using a `fileHandler`. Additionally, the application can serve TLS requests if a TLS key and certificate are provided. However, the exact details of how the application handles requests and responses are not fully specified in the provided context.</pre>

## Step 4 <a name='checklist-step-4' id='checklist-step-4'></a> : Check for Regression Impact


> **Input**: *Check for Regression Impact: Since this vulnerability is a regression of a previously fixed issue, verify if the containerized environment relies on authorization plugins that introspect the request or response body to make access control decisions. If so, assess the potential impact of this regression on the environment's security.*

> **Response**: *The container image does not rely on authorization plugins that introspect the request or response body to make access control decisions. However, the regression in a previously fixed vulnerability may still have security implications, including the potential for exploitation and compromise of the environment.*

### Step 4.1 : *Container Image Code QA System*<a name='checklist-step-4.1' id='checklist-step-4.1'></a>
